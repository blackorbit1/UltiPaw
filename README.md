## Testing SSL failures on Windows

The easiest way to test UltiPaw's connectivity failure UI is now built into the package.

1. Open an avatar with the `UltiPaw` component.
2. Enable `Advanced Mode`.
3. In `Connectivity Simulation`, set `API simulation` to:
   - `SSL Failure` to force requests to `https://wrong.host.badssl.com`
   - `Transport Failure` to force requests to `https://127.0.0.1:1`
4. Click `Retry connectivity check` or reopen the inspector.
5. Optionally click `Open connectivity tests` to run the standalone diagnostics window against the simulated target.

`SSL Failure` is the fast path if you specifically want certificate validation errors. `Transport Failure` is useful when you only want to verify the "cannot connect" report UI.

Turn `API simulation` back to `Off` when you want the package to use the real `api.orbiters.cc` / `dev.api.orbiters.cc` endpoints again.

## Manual fallback

If you still want to force a real local hostname mismatch on Windows outside the built-in simulation, the reliable manual approach is:

1. Map `api.orbiters.cc` or `dev.api.orbiters.cc` to `127.0.0.1` in `hosts`.
2. Run a local HTTPS listener on port `443`.
3. Present a certificate for a different hostname, such as `localhost`.

That will produce a genuine TLS hostname/certificate error for the real UltiPaw host names.
