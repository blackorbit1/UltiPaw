# AGENTS.md

## Language / Unity Constraints
- Unity compiles this package with `/langversion:9.0`.
- Do not introduce C# 10+ features (including global using) or compiler override changes.

## BlendShape Link System

### Goal
- Drive corrective activation from an already-animated source (`toFix`) to a target (`fixedBy`), multiplied by a factor.
- Supported target types:
  - `Blendshape`
  - `Animation`
- Apply this only to VRCFury-generated temporary controllers at build/preprocess time.
- Never mutate the original user-authored controllers directly.

### Two Link Sources

1. Manual link (Advanced Mode test drawer)
- UI: `Editor/Features/BlendShapeLinkTestDrawer.cs`
- Saved as persistent config in `UltiPaw.blendShapeFactorLinks`.
- Fields:
  - target renderer path
  - `toFixType`, `toFix`
  - `fixedByType`, `fixedBy`
  - factor parameter name
  - enabled flag

2. Current-version links (version JSON corrective definitions)
- Source data: `customBlendshapes[].correctives` (mapped internally to `correctiveBlendshapes`).
- Runtime/build fallback cache: `UltiPaw.appliedVersionBlendshapeLinksCache`.
- Links are generated per renderer when either side uses `Blendshape` (all skinned meshes, not only Body).
- Links with `Animation -> Animation` are generated once (no renderer path dependency).
- Factor selection:
  - If driver blendshape is an active slider: use slider global param.
  - If not: use a constant factor parameter with default value equal to current driver blendshape weight (0..1).

### VRCFury Interaction
- Sliders are created in `Editor/Services/VRCFuryService.cs`.
- For each slider toggle, force:
  - `content.useGlobalParam = true`
  - `content.globalParam = VRCFuryService.GetSliderGlobalParamName(sliderName)`
- This guarantees stable param names for version-based links.

### Build/Play Hook Execution
- Hook class: `Editor/Services/BlendShapeLinkPostVrcfuryHook.cs`
- Interface: `IVRCSDKPreprocessAvatarCallback`
- Order: `-9000` (after VRCFury, which runs at `-10000`).
- Runs for:
  - Upload build preprocess
  - Play mode preprocess path
- Applies:
  - version-based links
  - manual links

### Animator Mutation Strategy
- Core service is split (partial class):
  - `Editor/Services/BlendShapeLinkService.cs` (planning/lookup/signature build)
  - `Editor/Services/BlendShapeLinkService.LinkResolution.cs` (manual link resolution/validation)
  - `Editor/Services/BlendShapeLinkService.Rewrite.cs` (state machine + blendtree rewrite)
  - `Editor/Services/BlendShapeLinkService.VariantOps.cs` (clip variant creation/curve ops)
- Collect only VRCFury temp controllers (`com.vrcfury.temp`).
- For each matching motion (states and nested blendtrees):
  - clone clip as variant
  - apply corrective based on type combination:
    - `Blendshape -> Blendshape`: destination blendshape curve copied from source blendshape curve
    - `Animation -> Blendshape`: destination blendshape forced to 100 in matching animation clips
    - `Blendshape -> Animation`: overlay animation curves blended by source blendshape activation
    - `Animation -> Animation`: overlay animation curves copied to matching animation clips
  - create wrapper 1D blend tree with factor parameter:
    - child 0 threshold 0: original clip
    - child 1 threshold 1: variant clip
  - rewrite state/tree motion refs to wrapper
- Wrapper stacking:
  - if a wrapper for the same factor already exists, recurse into the wrapper variant child so multiple links can stack safely.
- Ensure factor parameter exists as Float in each processed controller.
- Wrapper/variant assets are attached as sub-assets to the temporary controller.

### Animation Matching Rules (`toFixType = Animation`)
- Never rely on VRCFury temp asset paths.
- Matching priority:
  - 1) Semantic signature match against the reference `toFix` animation clip:
    - same animated binding (`path`, `type`, `propertyName`)
    - same sampled values (epsilon-tolerant)
  - 2) Normalized clip name match (`clip.name`)
  - 3) Normalized source file name match (`*.anim` name)
- Normalization:
  - case-insensitive
  - strips `.anim`
  - removes non-alphanumeric characters

### Clone / Upload Robustness
- Preprocess may run on cloned avatar objects with editor-only components missing.
- `BlendShapeLinkService.FindUltiPaw` includes fallback lookup by root name against scene `UltiPaw` instances.
- Version links additionally fall back to serialized cache (`appliedVersionBlendshapeLinksCache`) when `appliedUltiPawVersion` is unavailable.

### Version Cache Synchronization
- `Editor/Features/VersionManagement/VersionActions.cs` synchronizes version blendshape cache:
  - set on apply/match
  - clear on reset/custom-version application
- This keeps upload preprocess deterministic even when full version objects are not present.

### Advanced Mode Debug UX
- Drawer shows:
  - manual test controls (enable/disable + save config)
  - live list of active version links
  - per-link typed endpoints (`toFixType:toFix -> fixedByType:fixedBy`)
  - factor parameter name
  - exact constant factor value for non-slider links
- Link debug data comes from `BlendShapeLinkService.GetActiveVersionLinkDebugInfo`.

### Important Rules
- Do not patch default/read-only VRChat package controllers.
- Do not patch authoring controllers directly.
- Keep link operations idempotent and safe across repeated preprocess calls.
- Keep naming deterministic for parameters and generated assets.
